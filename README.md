## FXCharts

This repo produces a runnable JavaFX application in which a user can input data and different built-in JavaFX charts
can be rendered from the data. It's still in development, so there is A LOT left to be desired, but bare with me, and 
pending my amount of free time, we should have a pretty nice application once I finish implementing all of the input 
templates for the charts and streamline it so that data entry is simple.
